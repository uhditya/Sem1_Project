Bombay sandwich is a traditional Indian sandwich originating from Mumbai, hence the name. In order to prepare it, green chutney is spread on a slice of crustless white sandwich bread, while butter is spread on the other slice. What goes in between the two slices is a medley of vegetables and spices such as sliced boiled potatoes, masala spices (cumin, fennel, black pepper cinnamon, chaat masala), tomatoes, green bell peppers, cucumbers, beetroot slices, and onion slices.
