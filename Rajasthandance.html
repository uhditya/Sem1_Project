Quintessentially Rajasthani, Ghoomar is probably the most popular folk dance in India.The women wear traditional outfit, which is ghagra (a long, swirling skirt) and kanchli or choli (a blouse). To complete the ensemble, a veil is worn covering the face. The beauty of this folk genre is in its graceful movements that involve swaying hands, beating palms and spinning around, while singing the traditional songs.
