Eriserry is cooked in a flavourful blend of coconut, vegetables and spices like turmeric, cumin and more. It tastes best with steamed rice. This dish is also an essential part of Sadhya feast that is prepared during festivities such as Onam.

Idiyappam is one of the most relished dishes in Kerala. These thin vermicelli are made with rice flour, salt and water. The strands are tucked together to give texture to the Idiyappam. These are traditionally served alongside any curry. The rich texture and plain taste of this dish complement savoury curries like egg curry perfectly. These are also known as ‘Noolappam’ in the state.

If you know anybody from Kerala, ask them about their favourite dish from their home state, and they will surely name Appam & stew. Appam is a rice pancake which has a thick and soft centre and a thin and crispy exterior. You can enjoy appam with a variety of dishes, and it will only enhance the flavour of the combination. It is usually relished with south Indian stews where veggies or meat is immersed in a coconut-based spicy gravy!
