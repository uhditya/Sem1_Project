Lambadi, which is a tribal dance of Andhra Pradesh, is a special art form. It owes its origin to the village of Anupu near Nagarjunakonda. The participants are tribal women who belong to the nomadic Senegalese and Banjara tribes. These women are heavily bedecked in colourful costumes and ornaments such as ivory bangles. The dresses are decorated with mirrors and sequins. The male drummers also dance along with the women as the dance gains momentum. The songs for this dance are sung in the Lambadi dialect.

Veernatyam dance form is performed by the Veeramusti community of Andhra Pradesh which claims to be the descendant of Veerabhadra. This is a vigorous dance form performed with instruments like Tambura, Soolam, Dolu, Tasha & Veeranam. This community is usually found at Draksharamam in East Godavari District. It is believed that Lord Shiva, performed an aggressive dance form, outraged at the humiliation of his consort. He plucked a strand out of his long hair and created the legendary Veerabhadra.
