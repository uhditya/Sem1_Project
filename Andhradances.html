Veernatyam dance form is performed by the Veeramusti community of Andhra Pradesh which claims to be the descendant of Veerabhadra. This is a vigorous dance form performed with instruments like Tambura, Soolam, Dolu, Tasha & Veeranam. This community is usually found at Draksharamam in East Godavari District. It is believed that Lord Shiva, performed an aggressive dance form, outraged at the humiliation of his consort. He plucked a strand out of his long hair and created the legendary Veerabhadra.
