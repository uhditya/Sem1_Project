This is the state’s classic signature dish. Baati is hard, unleavened bread cooked in the desert areas of Rajasthan. Baati is prized mainly for its long shelf life, plus it requires hardly any water for its preparation. It is always eaten with dal (lentil curry). The dal is made of lentils while churma is a coarsely ground wheat mixture crushed and cooked in ghee and jaggery or sugar.

Most of Rajasthani cusine came to fruition as a result of the arid conditions. For this dish you don’t need any fresh vegetables and that’s its speciality. This curry is made with gram flour dumplings (steamed and lightly fried) and tangy gravy made up of tomato, buttermilk and spices. It’s best enjoyed with rotis (Indian flat bread) and rice.

The shortage of rain and water always made Rajasthanis think out of the box, and this dish was a lifesaver when they ran out of vegetables. In this popular curry, roasted papads (thin Indian flatbreads made from lentils) are broken roughly and added to the yogurt gravy made with gram flour, chilli powder, turmeric and chopped coriander leaves. The result is a mouth watering curry usually served with steamed rice.
